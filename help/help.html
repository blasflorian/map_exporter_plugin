    <h1>How to use this plugin</h1>
    <h2>Functionality</h2>
        <p>
            This plugin lets you take a picture of the current map canvas. You can choose between
            different templates and file types. First you have to choose a directory. This decision is separately
            in case you have to take several screenshots. This allows you to easily put all exports in one directory.
            Next you type in a filename. <u>Note:</u> You do not have to add a file ending for the type, only the name.
        </p>

    <h2>Automatic file name creation</h2>
        <p>
            To make you life easier and to allow you to export different map scenes with one click there's and option
            to create file names automatically. You need to use keywords for this. Right now following keywords exist:
            <ul>
                <li>layername</li>
                <li>id</li>
                <li>date</li>
            </ul>
            All you have to do is put these keywords in brackets like this: {layername} and the file name is automatically
            set to the layer's name. The keyword "id" is allowing you to distinguish between the pictures. So a simple
            working example would be: {layername}_{id}. Now you just need to hit the export button and all the files
            will be saved to the chosen directory. <u>Note:</u> You can add what you desire around the keywords, for
            example: this-is-the-{id}-layer-with-name-{layername}
            When using the option to export all features of the layer you can choose a field from the attribute table.
            The label will then have the feature's value from the table.
        </p>
    <h2>Current Problems:</h2>
        <p>
            If you wish to export all features of selected layers, there's the option to choose a field for the filename.
            Right now you can only choose between fields that occur in all layers. For a correct creation of this list
            it is necessary to first select all layers and then hit the checkbox.
